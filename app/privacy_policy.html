            </h3>
            <p>
              In using the Services you may be asked to provide us a variety of
              information including personally identifiable and non-personally
              identifiable information. We may collect, store, and share this personal
              information with third parties, consistent with the terms of this Privacy
              Policy. Here are some examples of the following types of personal
              information we collect from you:

            <p>
              Personally identifiable information is data that can be used to contact or
              identify a single person. Through your own submissions, Users: we collect
              your name, phone number, mailing address, and e-mail address; Providers: we
              collect your name, address, email address, telephone number, and website
              address.

            <p>
              The Services allow Users to search and review content on technological
              developments and technology Providers, and to contact Providers. The
              Services provide Providers the opportunity to provide information to Users
              and review statistics concerning that.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use your contact information—primarily email addresses—for
              Service-related notices, including notices relating to the Services,
              Service updates and features, communications for administrative purposes,
              and any formal notices required by law.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Providers, contact information and Provider’s content will be displayed
              publicly, including to all Users. Where Users choose to e-mail content to
              third parties, that Provider contact information and content will be sent
              to that third party.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Users, we provide access to your personal information to our personnel
              and third parties for the purpose of providing you our Services, and to
              Providers where Users choose to disclose that information to those
              Providers.<strong> </strong><strong></strong>

              operating system, web browser or other software, language preference, and

              to perform research on how to make the Services better for our Users and
              Providers. This research may be compiled, analyzed, or sold on an
              aggregated basis, which does not include information identifying individual
              Users or Providers. The Company and its affiliates may share this
              aggregated data with business partners or other third parties to better
              understand our User and Providers, how the website is used, and how it can
              be made more effective for Users and Providers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Within the Services, we will maintain statistics concerning the number of
              Users who subscribe to specific Providers and who view specific articles.
              These statistics, which do not identify specific Users, will be shared
              publicly.

            <p>
              Some technologies, such as web browsers or mobile devices, provide a
              setting that when turned on sends a Do Not Track (DNT) signal when browsing
              a website or app. There is currently no common standard for responding to
              DNT Signals or even in the DNT signal itself. We do not currently have a
              mechanism in place to process DNT signals. However, we only track browsing
              history to determine the raw number of Users, without identifying specific
              Users, for the purpose of calculating the total number of Users who
              subscribe to a specific Provider and read specific Provider content.
