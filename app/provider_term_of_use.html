              The Company, through the website Teckedin.com, provides a website/platform

              integrators) (“Users”) and technology providers (“Providers”). Users can
              search and read content concerning technology and technology providers, and

              content and obtain stats on user activity. Users and Providers can interact
              by Users subscribing to Providers (and their content) and by Users
              requesting additional information from Providers through the Services.

              trade shows for Providers and Users to present and discuss technology.

            </p>
            <p>
              The Company offers Providers a free trial period of the Services. This
              trial period includes a 7 calendar day period from the state date for
              Provider to upload content to the Services, and a 60 calendar day period
              following that for Provider to use the Services.

              <strong>Payment</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to the end of the trial period (normally, approximately fifteen days
              prior), the Company will contact Provider concerning a subscription to the
              Services. If Provider wishes to continue using the Services, Provider will
              sign up for a monthly or yearly subscription by providing a credit card or
              other automatic billing information to the Company.
            </p>

              <strong>C. </strong>
              <strong>Billing</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Payments will be made via automatic billing on or near the first of each
              month for that month, for monthly subscriptions; and on or near the first
              of each year, for yearly subscriptions. Where Provider’s trial period does
              not end on the first of the month or year, Provider will be immediately
              billed a pro-rated amount (calculated on a 30-day month or 12-month year)
              for the remainder of the month or year at that time. Billing will then
              continue as above. By signing up for a subscription, Provider is
              authorizing this repeat charge.

            <p>
              To cancel the Services, Provider must notify the Company, in writing, of
              its desire to cancel the Services at least 7 full calendar days prior to
              the first of the coming month.

              <strong>Refund Policy—Monthly Subscribers</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              There are no refunds for monthly subscribers. If a monthly subscriber
              cancels its subscription during a paid month, there is no refund for any
              remainder of that month. If a monthly subscriber cancels 7 or fewer days
              before the first of the coming month, the subscriber will be charged for
              the coming month.
            </p>
            <p class="title">
              <strong>F. </strong>
              <strong>Refund Policy—Yearly Subscribers</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              For yearly subscribers, a prorated refund is available for any full month
              remaining in the calendar year after cancellation, provided the yearly
              subscriber cancels at least 7 full calendar days prior to the first of the
              coming month. A yearly subscriber will not receive a refund for the coming
              month if it does not cancel at least 7 full calendar days prior to the
              first of the coming month.

            <p>
              To protect the Company and its Users and Providers, the Company reserves an
              unrestricted right to refuse, terminate, block, or cancel your access to
              and involvement with the Services at any time, with or without cause. You
              acknowledge here that you have no right to use of the Services should the
              Company terminate or suspend your access. Primary reasons warranting
              termination (and primary reasons leading to suspension pending
              investigation of claims or evidence of the following) include:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Violating any of the provisions of the Agreement;

              4. Using the Services or Content in violation of any international,
              federal, state, or local law, or applicable regulation, rule, or order by
              any regulatory, governing, or private authority, or a court of competent
              jurisdiction.

            <p>
              Upon termination of Services—either immediately, if by the Company, or on
              the final day of your subscription, if through your cancellation—you will
              lose access to uploading or editing content, viewing statistics, and other
              features of the Service. The Company, in its sole discretion, may remove
              some or all of your content upon termination of Services, but retains the
              right to leave content displayed, maintain/transfer content saved in Users’
              individual electronic storage, and allow Users to e-mail the content,
              regardless of your termination.

              agents, and successors in their role and relationship with the Company. You

              The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or
              relating to the Agreement (including any alleged breach), or the Services,
              shall be binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration
              Association. You may not under any circumstances commence or maintain
              against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other
              representative action or proceeding. Parties understand and accept that, by

            <p>
              The Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
              of the State of Colorado. The venue for any disputes including mediation,
              arbitration, or litigation shall be Denver, Colorado. Each party agrees to
              waive the following defenses to any action brought in Colorado:<em>forum non conveniens</em> and lack of
              personal
              jurisdiction. <strong></strong>

              E. Waiver
            </p>
            <p>
              If one party waives any term or provision of the Agreement at any time,
              that waiver will only be effective for the specific instance and specific
              purpose for which the waiver was given. If either party fails to exercise
              or delays exercising any of its rights or remedies under the Agreement or
              the Privacy Policy, that party retains the right to enforce that term or
              provision at a later time.

              If any provision of the Agreement or the Privacy Policy is invalid or
              unenforceable, whether by the decision of an arbitrator or court, by
              passage of a new law, or otherwise, the remainder of those agreements will
              remain in effort and be construed and enforced consistent with the purpose
