					<p><font color="white"> The following are some of the common Provider questions we receive:</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
			♦ What is required to sign up and how much does it cost?
				<p> You will need to provide your email, name and location and some information about your company. This will be fed into your Company Profile. There is no charge at this time for providers.</p>
				<br>
				♦ I signed up, but I don't come up in a search.
				<p> Our site is content-driven. Even though you signed up and you have a Company Profile, you need content uploaded before you will be seen on our platform. </p>
				<br>
				♦ How many users do you have?
				<p> Because all of our content is provided by Solution Providers, we have focused first on getting content into the platform. We are building user interest by participating in tradeshows, Google ads and linkedin.</p>
				<br><p>We are doing 3 tradeshows in September - Colorado Smart Cities Symposium, San Jose Cybersecurity Symposium, IT Summit Denver.</p>
				<br>
				♦ Can I sign up as both a user and provider?
				<p> Yes, however, the email address used has to be different.</p>
				<br>
				♦ Can Teckedin being integrated with HootSuite and other apps that we currently use?
				<p> Future development is in the works for this integration.</p>
