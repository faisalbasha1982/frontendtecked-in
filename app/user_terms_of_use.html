            <p>
              The Company, through the website Teckedin.com, provides a website/platform
              for technology users (such as business executives, solution providers, and
              integrators) (“Users”) and technology providers (“Providers”). Users can
              search and read content concerning technology and technology providers, and
              save that content to individual electronic storage. Providers can upload
              content and obtain stats on user activity. Users and Providers can interact
              by Users subscribing to Providers (and their content) and by Users
              requesting additional information from Providers through the Services.
              Furthermore, the Company provides an online forum to organize and execute
              trade shows for Providers and Users to present and discuss technology.

              You agree that any waiver or protections afforded to the Company are also
              provided to its affiliates, directors, officers, principals, employees,
              agents, and successors in their role and relationship with the Company. You
              also acknowledge that all waivers and agreements bind not only you, but any
              successors, heirs, agents, and other representatives.<strong></strong>

              C. Arbitration
            </strong>
            <p>
              The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or
              relating to the Agreement (including any alleged breach), or the Services,
              shall be binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration
              Association. You may not under any circumstances commence or maintain
              against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other
              representative action or proceeding. Parties understand and accept that, by
              agreeing to arbitration, Parties are foregoing their access to a trial by
              jury.<strong></strong>

              D. Governing Law and Venue
            </strong>
            <p>
              The Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
              of the State of Colorado. The venue for any disputes including mediation,
              arbitration, or litigation shall be Denver, Colorado. Each party agrees to
              waive the following defenses to any action brought in Colorado:<em>forum non conveniens</em> and lack of
              personal jurisdiction. <strong></strong>
            </p>
            <strong class="title">
              E. Waiver
            </strong>
            <p>
              If one party waives any term or provision of the Agreement at any time,
              that waiver will only be effective for the specific instance and specific
              purpose for which the waiver was given. If either party fails to exercise
              or delays exercising any of its rights or remedies under the Agreement or
              the Privacy Policy, that party retains the right to enforce that term or
              provision at a later time.

              F. Severability
            </strong>
            <p>
              If any provision of the Agreement or the Privacy Policy is invalid or
              unenforceable, whether by the decision of an arbitrator or court, by
              passage of a new law, or otherwise, the remainder of those agreements will
              remain in effort and be construed and enforced consistent with the purpose
              of those agreements.
